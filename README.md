# plants-frontend

What features are required for your minimum viable product?

Signup Form - username, phone number and password

Login Form - username and password

Landing Page - user can Create, Update, and Delete a plant

    Created plant form must have these values, as well as the edit function.
    *Each plant must have
    - `id`: Integer
    - `nickname`: String
    - `species` : String
    - `h2oFrequency`: Type determined by implementation
    - `image`: (optional)

Need buttons to be able to update, and delete the plant

A display page that has all the plants the user has created, maybe a way to see what other users have created as well.

Authenticated `user` can update their `phoneNumber` and `password`.

Logout button on landing page to remove token and route user back to home page.

If thereâ€™s time: Allow user to upload a custom image for plant
